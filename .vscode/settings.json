/* There are 3 settings files:
 - Folder: settings.json in the .vscode directory in the workspace root which applies to project-perform folder
 - Workspace: 'xxx-workspace.json' file in the workspace root which applies to the workspace
 - User: Users/cname87/AppData/Roaming/Code/User/settings.json directory on Window, or ~/.vscode/settings.json on linux, which applies to the User.
 - I try keep all settings in the 'xxx-workspace.json' file.
 */

 /* Note also there is a keybindings.json file containing custom keyboard shortcuts that is stored in the same place as the User settings file i.e. dependent on the OS.
