# Parallel Parking

## Purpose

The purpose is to help the user understand how best to parallel park their car.  It allows the user experiment with different parallel parking manoeuvres, i.e. sequences of reversing manoeuvres, and watch the result on the canvas to allow angles and distances be visualised.  It includes a proposed ideal parking manoeuvre that the user can review on the canvas. All key dimensions are configurable so the user can set up the canvas to match their car.

- It is not a review of the mathematics involved.  The underlying mathematics are lifted from referenced papers.
- It is not just an animation of the ideal manoeuvre - the user can play with other sequences of manoeuvres to gain an appreciation of how varying the manoeuvres affects the outcome.  
- It is not a parking game where you steer a car via the keyboard or other input device attempting to park in different situations.

## Background

I drive a VW long wheel base Transporter van so I have an interest in being able to parallel park efficiently.
