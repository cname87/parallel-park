1. Street.service
  1. Clear up the use of fixed values in street.service
  2. Rationalize the use of safety gap in bay parking mode in street.service - it's a bit all over the place since I moved to the cars filling the parking spaces.

2. Fix any errors in the automated modes.

3. Complete the bay parking mode parking scenario
