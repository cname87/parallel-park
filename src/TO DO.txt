TO DO:

1. 2. Fix any errors in the all the modes.

2. Street.service
  1. Clear up the use of fixed values in street.service
  2. Rationalize the use of safety gap in bay parking mode in street.service - it's a bit all over the place since I moved to the cars filling the parking spaces.

3. Complete the bay parking mode parking scenario

4. Overhaul rules.service completely - how can I make the whole program more robust to change.

5. Split screen.service up - it does too much.
